# Customize DayPicker

Change months, weeks and days in the calendar.

## Showing the Outside Days

Use `showOutsideDays` to display the days falling out the current month.

import OutsideDays from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/outside-days.tsx';

<SourceCode fileName="outside-days.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <OutsideDays />
</RenderingBox>

## Render Multiple Months

Use `numberOfMonths` to render more than one calendar.

<SourceCode fileName="multiple-months.tsx" />

import MultipleMonths from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/multiple-months.tsx';

<RenderingBox>
  <MultipleMonths />
</RenderingBox>

Toggle `pagedNavigation` to navigate the number of months per time.

<SourceCode fileName="multiple-months-paged.tsx" />

import MultipleMonthsPaged from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/multiple-months-paged.tsx';

<RenderingBox>
  <MultipleMonthsPaged />
</RenderingBox>

## Using Fixed Weeks

Use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per months. This will prevent the calendar to change its height when navigating.

<SourceCode fileName="fixedweeks.tsx" />

import FixedWeeks from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/fixedweeks.tsx';

<RenderingBox>
  <FixedWeeks />
</RenderingBox>

## Show the Week Numbers

Use `showWeekNumber` to display the week numbers. When this prop is set, use `onWeekNumberClick` to handle the click on a week number.

import WeekNumber from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/weeknumber.tsx';

<SourceCode fileName="weeknumbers.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <WeekNumber />
</RenderingBox>

### Customize the Week Numbers

- To set the first day of the week, use `weekStartsOn`.
- To set the day of January in the first week of the year `firstWeekContainsDate`.
- Use the `formatWeekNumber` formatter to change how week numbers are displayed.

<SourceCode fileName="weeknumber-custom.tsx" />

import WeekNumberCustom from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/weeknumber-custom.tsx';

<RenderingBox>
  <WeekNumberCustom />
</RenderingBox>

## Switch to ISO Week Dates

DayPicker uses [date-fns getWeek](https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeek) to calculate the week number. By default, the week starts on Sunday and the first week of the year is the one that contains January 1st. Use `ISOWeek` to switch using [ISO Week Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) instead of the locale setting.

import WeekNumberISO from 'react-day-picker/docs/examples/weeknumber-iso.tsx';

<SourceCode fileName="weeknumber-iso.tsx" />

<RenderingBox>
  <WeekNumberISO />
</RenderingBox>
